				<p>Set after the events of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, The Lost Legacy follows Chloe Frazer,
				a fan-favorite treasure hunter from earlier Uncharted games. 
				She teams up with Nadine Ross, a mercenary and former antagonist from Uncharted 4, 
				to locate the legendary Tusk of Ganesh in the Western Ghats of India.
				The story delves into Chloe's background and heritage, her relationship with her father,
				and the complicated dynamic between her and Nadine.
				Together, they face off against a ruthless warlord named Asav, who is seeking the tusk for his own militant agenda.</p>

		        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
		        <p>The gameplay sticks close to the series' roots with third-person action, cinematic storytelling, and environmental puzzles.

			    scripted sequences.</p>

		       <h2>Characters</h2>
		       <p>Chloe Frazer shines as the lead, bringing charisma and depth. 
			    Her partnership with Nadine Ross adds a dynamic blend of conflict, banter, and growth throughout the story.
